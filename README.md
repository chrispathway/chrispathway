Finance Student | Data Scientist 
```

Hey! I'm Chris 👋

I'm a finance graduate who self-taught programming and fell in love with data. I'm passionate about **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and turning complex data into actionable insights.

I completed my **Bachelor's in Finance** and have since gained hands-on experience in **strategy consulting** and as a **Data Scientist at an investment fund** — where I got to combine my finance background with real-world machine learning applications.

I believe the intersection of **finance and technology** is where the most exciting problems live, and that's exactly where I want to be.
